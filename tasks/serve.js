/**
 * grunt serve starts a live-reloading server for development of your app
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The connect task simulates the NGINX UAA integration, allowing you to talk to secure CloudFoundry services.
 * You will need to update the UAA configuration for your app in /tasks/options/connect.js.
 *
 * Additionally, you will need to add any services you are proxying in the NGINX layer to /tasks/options/connect.js.
